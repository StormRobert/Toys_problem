## Project Description
# Challenge 1: Grade Generator
Creating a function that asks the user to enter their students' marks. The input should range from 0 to 100. The output should match the right grade respectively demonstrated as follows:  A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

## challenge 2: Speed Detector
Create a program that checks a car's speed. If it's 70 or less, it's fine (prints "Ok"). If it's more than 70, for every 5 km/h over 70, add one point and print the total points. If points reach 12 or more, print "License suspended."

### challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
Create a program that figures out how much money someone earns after taking out taxes and deductions. You'll need to enter their basic salary and benefits, and then the program will calculate their taxes, NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and final net salary.
